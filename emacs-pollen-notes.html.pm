◊p{Here are some notes and tips on using pollen with Emacs}

◊p{Packages to use}

◊itemize{
  ◊item{Pollen-mode: Namely for the fact that it can easily insert lozenge,
                     syntax highlighting,
                     and start the Pollen server.}
  ◊item{Yas-snippet: For easy insertion of more complex commands like links
                     and also for a template/ draft / outline of your text.}
  ◊item{Spellcheck:  I use recomplete since it is fast
                            and I don't need the redline.}
  ◊item{Smartparens: Due to working with brackets,
                     nesting is easy to deal with
                     and automatically jumps you inside the brackets when you make it.}

<p>Packages to use</p>

<ul><li><p>Pollen-mode: Namely for the fact that it can easily insert lozenge,
             syntax highlighting,
             and start the Pollen server.</p></li>
<li><p>Magit:       Fast and featureful git front-end.
             See also <a href="https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter">git gutter</a>
             and <a href="https://github.com/magit/forge">forge</a></p></li>
<li><p>Yas-snippet: For easy insertion of more complex commands like links
             and also for a template/ draft / outline of your text.</p></li>
<li><p>Spellcheck:  I use recomplete since it is fast
             and I don't need the redline.</p></li>
<li><p>Smartparens: Due to working with brackets,
             nesting is easy to deal with
             and automatically jumps you inside the brackets when you make it.</p></li>
<li><p>Consult:     consult-line and consult-ripgrep are quite useful functions that make finding things way easier</p></li>
<li><p>Avy: It can do <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/">a lot of useful stuff</a>,
     I mainly using it for yanking and googling things.
     It basically replaces fine mouse movements.</p></li>
<li><p>Neotree: Usually don't use it but it is nice to have a side overview of the whole project.</p></li>
<li><p>read-aloud.el: Not the cleanest,
               but it is useful for proof-reading.</p></li></ul>

<p>On general style</p>
